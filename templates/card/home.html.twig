    <h1>21 Game</h1>
</div><br>

<p>The following links and routes are the groundworks of a game called "21", which works similarly to the game
"Blackjack", where the player needs to get 21 points and not overshoot or get less than the dealer.
For a more in depth instructions guide on the game, visit <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tjugoett_(kortspel)"> 
this link</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, you can only draw cards, shuffle and view your current deck. To create a deck, visit the deck route or shuffle route. 
To draw one card, visit the simple draw route. If you want to draw more at once, visit the draw/:num route.</p>

<p>
    In this program, i have three main classes. The "CardHand" class, that holds cards and can be shuffled, created, added to with methods such as "shuffle", which creates a new CardHand object and adds all cards and shuffles them, 
    "wholeDeck", which uses the class "CardGraphic" (which has a variable called representation that stores the abbreviations and their respective unicode cards) to create and return an array holding all cards sorted in a deck, "add", which adds one Card object to the CardHand, and more. 
    The "Card" class holds methods such as "cardToUnicode", which takes the abbreviation of the card name and links it to a unicode graphic of the card,, and "getAsString" which returns the string value of the current card.<br>
    The other class "CardGraphic" only holds the "representation" variable, which I already stated, holds the abbreviations to unicode.<br>
    The classes are related in a composition relationship, since for the program to function as intended, we must have a deck of cards, which the CardHand object fulfills, and that object must contain Card objects to compose a deck.<br><br>
    The following is an UML diagram showing the two classes' relationship:<br><br>
